## Goal behind

The objective here was to apply skills learned during past tutorials and make an app with functionality all by myself. I then added some change to the basic app asked in the challenge. 

## General Info

Just ask the app to make all hard decision, once the question asked just shake your phone and the answer will appear in the helmet of the astronaut!

The empty project has been cloned from the github repository of the ***App Brewery***, the next step was to design a basic User Interface containing an image of a 8-ball and a "ask" button. Everything was then connected using IBOutlets and the code made so that when the user presses the "ask" button the image changes to a random selection giving an answer.

I went further with this app by redesigning the UI. Usually Magic 8 balls need to be shaken to have an answer and I thought that would be more intuitive than a button as people are used to shake the 8 ball. Then I changed the assets of the 8 ball to have a space look.

## Technologies

This project uses:
* *Xcode: 13.4.1*
* *Swift: 5.6.1*
